# Sudoku Solver Project (Backtracking)

This repository contains the mini project report for **Sudoku Solver using Backtracking**, developed as part of the **Data Structures** course (2nd semester, 1st year) at **K. Ramakrishnan College of Engineering**, Department of AI & ML.

## 📌 Project Overview

🔹 This project demonstrates the use of the **Backtracking algorithm** to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles efficiently.  
🔹 It highlights how different data structures (arrays, stacks, sets) can be integrated to support recursive logic and constraint checking.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- Backtracking algorithm  
- Recursive search and constraint satisfaction  
- Data structure usage (Array, Stack, Set)  
- Sudoku grid validation logic  

## 📘 Contents

- ✅ Project report in PDF format (`Sudoku_Solver_Report.pdf`)  
- ✅ Explanation of methodology and future scope  
- (Optional) Source code in C (if added later)

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Programming Language: C  
- Compiler: GCC / Turbo C (for academic demo)  
- Editor: Code::Blocks / VS Code  

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI)  
- Implement puzzle generation mode  
- Optimize for larger boards (16x16 Sudoku)
